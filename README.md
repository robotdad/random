# random

This is a random number generator library, an executable that uses it, and a unit test. 
This was created through a series of prompts to ChatGPT that I interpreted the answer from to produce this project. 
See the full [discussion log](ChatGPTlog.md) if you are interested in the prompts and direct responses. 
It is not trimmed and has minimal annotations. Everything I asked, including dead ends, is present.
